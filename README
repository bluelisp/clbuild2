clbuild 2.0
===========

http://gitorious.org/clbuild2
git clone git://gitorious.org/clbuild2/clbuild2.git


This is clbuild 2.0, a shell script with the following features:

  - clbuild makes it easy to start Lisp and SLIME with a good default
    configuration

  - Used a wrapper for Quicklisp, it automatically downloads Quicklisp
    if needed, and has command line argument quickload Lisp projects
    from the shell.

    In this mode, all downloading and dependency tracking for Lisp
    projects is done by Quicklisp and ASDF.

  - Like classic clbuild from darcs, the current version still supports
    download from projects directly from upstream's version control.

    If you choose this installation method for a project, the
    version-controlled checkout overrides any previous installation made
    by Quicklisp.

Usage

History
-------

This version of clbuild (maintained in git) is a slighly refactored fork
of the classic clbuild script (maintained in darcs).

classic clbuild was written by Luke Gorrie and contributors.
Idea from jhbuild by James Henstridge (a Gnome hacker).
